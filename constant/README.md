| `azure.go`           | Defines global constants related to Azure, such as `AzureNoRemoveDotTime` (controls the cutoff time for removing `.`).         || `cache_key.go`       | Cache key format string and constants related to Token, unified cache naming rules.                                    || `channel_setting.go` | Channel level setting keys, such as `proxy`, `force_format`, etc.                          || `context_key.go`     | Defines the `ContextKey` type and the context key constants used throughout the project (request time, Token/Channel/User related information, etc.). || `env.go`             | Global variables related to environment configuration, injected during the startup phase based on configuration files or environment variables.                                     || `finish_reason.go`   | Collection of `finish_reason` string constants returned by OpenAI/GPT requests.                           || `midjourney.go`      | Mapping table of Midjourney related error codes and action constants to actions.                            || `setup.go`           | Indicates whether the project has completed the initial setup (`Setup` boolean value).                                       || `task.go`            | Various task platforms, action constants, and model-to-action mapping tables, such as Suno, Midjourney, etc.                     || `user_setting.go`    | Constants related to user settings and notification types (Email/Webhook), etc.                                    |
## Usage Agreement
1. The `constant` package **can only be referenced by other packages** (import), **it is prohibited to reference other custom packages within this package**. If necessary, only **the Go standard library** is allowed.2. Writing any logic code related to business processes, database operations, third-party service calls, etc., is not allowed in this directory.3. When adding a new type, please keep the naming semantics clear and supplement the description in the **current file** table of this README to ensure team members can quickly understand its purpose.
> ⚠️ Violating the above agreement will lead to unnecessary coupling between packages, affecting code maintainability and testability. Please check before submitting your code.
